# Project Overview
Fourth project of Udacity's Web Development nanodegree. In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I was tasked to test various functions of the
application using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).

# Getting Started
1. To get started, download the starter code from [Udacity's repo](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader). 
2. Open index.html in the browser of your choice. Once loaded, test results from Jasmine will be displayed at the bottom of the page.
3. Add additional tests to feedreader.js document under the Jasmine file.

# Tech Used

* CSS
* Javascript
* Jasmine
