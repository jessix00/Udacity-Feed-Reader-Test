# Project Overview
Fourth project of Udacity's Web Development nanodegree. In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I was tasked to test various functions of the
application using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).

# Getting Started
To get started, download the starter code from [Udacity's repo](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader). 
You'll be adding your tests to feedreader.js under the Jasmine file under spec.

# Tech Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Jasmine

# Contribute
Here are some ways you can contribute to my project:

* by reporting bugs
* by suggesting new features
* by writing or editing documentation
* by writing code ( fix or add js files, add comments, modifying styles)
